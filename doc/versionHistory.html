<h1><a href="index.html">ARCTIC Filter Wheel</a> Version History</h1>

<h4>2.1 2018-07-19<h4>
<ul>
    <li> 2.0 wasn't running...my local version was, so I just tagged it here.
</ul>

<h4>2.0 2018-07-19<h4>
<ul>
    <li> Completely move and re-wrap C codebase (evgpio and arcus) into product.  Change move strategy to move incrementally 1 filter at a time and verifying a detection for every position bit hall sensor.  When a position bit is sensed the motor is commanded to stop (with decel).  The motor parameters have been tuned such that the wheel should decelerate into the center (+- 10 steps) of the magnent.
